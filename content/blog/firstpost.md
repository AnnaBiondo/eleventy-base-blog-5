i hope this works!

It’s the start of a new half term and full steam ahead for Key Stage One!

It has been the launch of our new book across KS1 this week ‘Cloudy with a chance of Meatballs’. We have been learning about a town that has no food shops, because all their food is delivered from the sky in the weather! We spent time discussing what food we would like to fall from the sky and created pictures of food falling on us. Year one made pancakes and described different foods using appropriate adjectives. Year two have been focusing on writing sentences using conjunctions.

In Maths this week Year one have been looking at two different things. One group have been looking at partitioning numbers using Base 10 and one group have been finding the difference between two numbers using lots of different Maths resources. In year two they have begun multiplication. They have introduced this concept by beginning with repeated addition.

We have been looking at globes and maps in Geography this week and learning about the equator. We looked at how the countries closest to the equator have warmer weather and those further away are colder.


## Maths and English

We have had the Beebots out in computing this week. We linked it to Geography and looked at how to program the Beebot to travel from one place on the UK map to another place. Year one were focusing on basic operations of how to make the Beebot move and turn.

In our history lessons this week, we were learning about different sources to find out information and to learn about things from the past. We thought about visual, audio, physical and written such as newspapers, older people, buildings etc… We thought about different sources that would come under each of these categories.

We have continued with our seasons topic in Science. This week we were comparing Winter and Spring. We looked at how many day light hours there are, what is happening with the trees and what clothes we need to wear due to the weather.

It has been lovely to see all the children’s happy faces back this week and we look forward to a fabulous half term.
